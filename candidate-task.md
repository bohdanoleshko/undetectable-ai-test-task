# Task: Text Summarizer

We are building a simple **Text Summarizer** application that leverages OpenAI APIs for summarizing user-provided content. The application should allow users to **create**, **update**, **delete**, and **list** summarized texts (CRUD functionality).

Below are the detailed requirements and expectations for this task:

---

## **Requirements**

### **1. Authentication**
- Implement a dummy authentication system:
  - Create a `User` table with fields for `username` and `password`.
  - Users should be able to sign up/sign in/sign out, and sessions should be validated using **cookies**.
  - Keep the authentication implementation simple.

### **2. Text Summarization Management**
- Use OpenAI APIs to summarize texts.
- Provide CRUD functionality for the summarized texts:
  - **Create**: Summarize a user-provided text using OpenAI API and save it in the database.
  - **Read**: List all saved summaries for the logged-in user.
  - **Update**: Allow users to update/edit a saved summary.
  - **Delete**: Allow users to delete a saved summary.

### **3. Tech Stack**
- Use the following technologies:
  - **Next.js 14** (App Router).
  - **Server actions** instead of internal API endpoints.
  - **Server components** for pages (client components can be used within server components where necessary).
  - **Typescript**.
  - **Supabase** for database (You can use the cloud one: supabase.com).
  - **Prisma** for ORM.
  - **OpenAI APIs** for content summarization.
  - **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
  - **Zustand** for state management.

### **4. Deployment**
- Host the project on **Vercel**.
- Use **GitHub** for source control:
  - Follow best practices for committing and branching.
  - Use clear commit messages and a feature-based branching strategy.

### **5. User Experience**
- Ensure the application has a **clean and user-friendly interface**.
